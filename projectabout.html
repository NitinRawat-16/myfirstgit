 	 <hr /> Project Name:- Fire Detection/Smoke Detector. <hr /><br>
 	<hr />  Description:- Fire detection systems are designed to discover fires early in their development when time will still be available for the safe evacuation of occupants. Early detection also plays a significant role in protecting the safety of emergency response personnel. Property loss can be reduced and downtime for the operation minimized through early detection because control efforts are started while the fire is still small. Most alarm systems provide information to emergency responders on the location of the fire, speeding the process of fire control.<hr />

 	  Sensors:- Flame Sensor: This Tiny Flame sensor infrared receiver module ignition source detection module is Arduino compatible can use to detect flame or wavelength of the light source within 760nm~1100nm also useful for Lighter flame detect at the distance 80cm.

Greater the flame, farther the test distance. It has the Detect angle of 60 and very sensitive to flame spectrum.

It produces the one channel output signal at the D0 terminal for further processing like an alarm system or any switching system. The sensitivity is adjustable with the help of blue potentiometer given on the board.

 

<p>Features:-
1. Indicator light: a green one for the switch, a red one for power.<br>
2. Built in a potentiometer for sensitivity control.<br>
3. Onboard signal output indication, output effective signal is high, at the same time the indicator light up, the output signal can directly connect to microcontroller IO.<br>
4. Can detect fire or wavelength in 760 ~ 1100 nm nano within the scope of the light source.<br>
5. Detection angle about 60 degrees, the flame spectrum especially sensitive.<br>
6. The flame of the most sensitive sensors flame, the regular light is also a response, generally used for fire alarm purposes.</p><hr />

  Arduino Uno:- The Arduino Uno is one kind of microcontroller board based on ATmega328, and Uno is an Italian term which means one. Arduino Uno is named for marking the upcoming release of microcontroller board namely Arduino Uno Board 1.0. This board includes digital I/O pins-14, a power jack, analog i/ps-6, ceramic resonator-A16 MHz, a USB connection, an RST button, and an ICSP header. All these can support the microcontroller for further operation by connecting this board to the computer. The power supply of this board can be done with the help of an AC to DC adapter, a USB cable, otherwise a battery.

 Raspberry Pi:- The Raspberry Pi is a very cheap computer that runs Linux, but it also provides a set of GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins, allowing you to control electronic components for physical computing and explore the Internet of Things (IoT).
<br><br>
Here are the various components on the Raspberry Pi board:-
<br><br>
ARM CPU/GPU: This is a Broadcom BCM2835 System on a Chip (SoC) that's made up of an ARM central processing unit (CPU) and a Videocore 4 graphics processing unit (GPU). The CPU handles all the computations that make a computer work (taking input, doing calculations and producing output), and the GPU handles graphics output. <br>
GPIO: These are exposed general-purpose input/output connection points that will allow the real hardware hobbyists the opportunity to tinker. <br>
RCA: An RCA jack allows connection of analog TVs and other similar output devices.<br>
Audio out: This is a standard 3.55-millimeter jack for connection of audio output devices such as headphones or speakers. There is no audio in.<br>
LEDs: Light-emitting diodes, for all of your indicator light needs.<br>
USB: This is a common connection port for peripheral devices of all types (including your mouse and keyboard). Model A has one, and Model B has two. You can use a USB hub to expand the number of ports or plug your mouse into your keyboard if it has its own USB port.<br>
HDMI: This connector allows you to hook up a high-definition television or other compatible device using an HDMI cable.<br>
Power: This is a 5v Micro USB power connector into which you can plug your compatible power supply.
SD cardslot: This is a full-sized SD card slot. An SD card with an operating system (OS) installed is required for booting the device. They are available for purchase from the manufacturers, but you can also download an OS and save it to the card yourself if you have a Linux machine and the wherewithal.<br>
Ethernet: This connector allows for wired network access and is only available on the Model B.<hr />
